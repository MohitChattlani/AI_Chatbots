Eminescu IQ Test- By
Robert Andacs
Know Your Author
My name is Andacs Robert Eugen, I am 13 years old and I am a member of Mensa Romania with an IQ of over 132. I have numerous IQ certificates with scores between 132-138 IQ, but the Mensa Romania IQ certificate is the most valuable so far. I am the founder and director of the site
bailey-universe.com (Bailey Universe)
that I founded on June 15, 2021. The site quickly enjoyed the attention of the public, now reaching tens of thousands of views per month.
About the Test:
This test consists of 30 Questions distributed across 3 levels in the Spatial and Verbal reasoning category.
The test has been designed in a way to make sure it is as close to being accurate as possible after years of research and experience.
Most multinational corporations use similar tests as part of their job candidates' selection process.
How to attempt?

You will be given
50 minutes
to attempt 30 questions.
You can submit your test when you are done or it shall be automatically submitted after 50 minutes.

ARM36 IQ Test- By
Andre Gangvik
Know Your Author
I was raised and born in Oslo, Norway.
Already as a young boy, I was mentioned by my social circles to be multitalented in various sports by the many kinds of events I attended. My favorite and main sport was Alpine Skiing, followed by Powerlifting.
In my early adulthood, I became curious and fascinated by the IQ tests, and thus tried to take a test to see how I did. 
As the score result qualified for Mensa, I have been a member since 2015.

Intertel- 99
CivIQ- 99.9
Triple Nine Society- 99.9
HelliQ- 99.997 (Subscriber)
GIFTED HIGH IQ Network and GENIUS HIGH IQ Network
My best IQ test score results, proctored, sd15:

Spatial Reasoning Matrices 40 IQ Test- By
Andre Gangvik
Know Your Author
I was raised and born in Oslo, Norway.
Already as a young boy, I was mentioned by my social circles to be multitalented in various sports by the many kinds of events I attended. My favorite and main sport was Alpine Skiing, followed by Powerlifting.
In my early adulthood, I became curious and fascinated by the IQ tests, and thus tried to take a test to see how I did. 
As the score result qualified for Mensa, I have been a member since 2015.
Memberships in other High IQ Societies, ranked by rarity percentiles:
Mensa- 98
Intertel- 99
CivIQ- 99.9
Triple Nine Society- 99.9
HelliQ- 99.997 (Subscriber)
GIFTED HIGH IQ Network and GENIUS HIGH IQ Network
My best IQ test score results, proctored, sd15:
FRT 135 99%, 1/100
Ravens 2 160 99.997%, 1/31500
My interests:
Studying
Have made IQ tests for World Intelligence Network WIN, by my first test called AGLT. This will be my second test contributed on Teslaberry, the first one was ARM36 which was widely accepted and appreciated by fellow community members. I suffer from a neurobiological disorder, called Tourettes Syndrome, where I got complex tics, since I was 9 years old.

This test consists of 40 Questions distributed across 4 levels in the Spatial-logical category.
The test has been designed in a way to make sure it is as close to being accurate as possible after years of research and experience.
The name of the test is SRM40 (Spatial Reasoning Matrices).
Most multinational corporations use similar tests as part of their job candidates' selection process.
How to attempt the test?
The fee of the test is $4.
In order to send payments you should have a PayPal Account. Payments will be sent from your PayPal Account to Our PayPal Account.

teslaberry| Blog | History and Facts of Puzzles | Why Problem Solving?
Return
History and facts
For a long time now, philosophers have questioned and developed physiological and psychological quests that demand determination, patience, and logic to work out. Such mental activities were particularly widespread in most of the historical civilizations, making our primitive types of puzzles, and the most common of these early forms of puzzles was
the maze
, which was an actual life-size maze.
The jigsaw puzzle
closely followed the maze and was effectively applied in teaching world geography in the 18th-century, after which came the later date word puzzles used by 20th-century newspapers to entertain readers. Over time, more puzzles have been developed and expanded to take on the many varied forms of fun puzzles available today, such as
the snake cube puzzle.
Researchers have continually made efforts towards the benefits of fun puzzles to solve, especially to the human mind, which has resulted in majority of scientists concurring on the fact that puzzles significantly enhance
the human intellectual process.
However, the benefits of puzzles rely on various factors like the capacity of psychological endurance, the degree of commitment to solve puzzles, and whether an individual opt for more demanding puzzles or not. Further, scientists have discovered that solving puzzles on a daily basis more often than not, results in best possible benefits. Although puzzles offer more than psychological benefits, almost all other benefits, such as the subsequent
increase in work productivity,
are consequently due to one or more combination of several other mental benefits.
Why Problem Solving?
Enhanced memory
Working out puzzles reinforces the existing connections between our brain cells and boosts generation of new relationships, both of which greatly enhance our
mental speed
and
thought process
. It is also a verified fact that puzzles are beneficial for all ages.
Jigsaw puzzles
are particularly useful for short-term memories because it needs a recollection of shapes and colors, plus an imagination of the bigger picture, in determining what pieces fit together.
Accelerated innovation
Great brain puzzles leads to the participants giving thought to issues in a completely different manner and although a notion might not be a problem’s solution, every thought that is outside the box assists in exercising our minds to operate efficiently in completely different ways.Through formulation of theories and testing hypotheses, we gain benefits of combining creativity with an empirical examination, this type of imagination often leads to
innovative
and
efficient problem-solving
skills in any field.
Meditation
On one hand, puzzles activate and innovate our brains, and on the other, they also help us relax psychologically. Recent studies show that merely skimming through puzzles while contemplating the possible solutions, significantly encourages our minds to relax, where our brains basically go into a
meditative state
. This alternatively assists us to achieve a
better mindset
which goes a long way towards a better management of stress and leads to overall increase in
productivity
and more
self-confidence
.
Conclusion
The importance of puzzles can be directly linked to how complex and demanding they are, even though every mind is unique in its own way and people possess different affinities for solving puzzles.Puzzles perform wonders to us, be it children, adults, or seniors, significantly benefit from improved memory,innovation and creativity.
